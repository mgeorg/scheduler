<h2>General Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>This program is very unforgiving about formatting.  If the instructions say that the first cell of some row needs a specific value in it, use exactly that value (excluding the quotes).  Do not add spaces, don't use a different case, don't change it in the slightest.  It won't work.</li>
<li>Follow these instructions carefully.  If the instructions say you should use a 1 character code for each day of the week and "U" stands for Sunday, then use "U".  Don't use "Sun" and expect the program to understand, it won't.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The first row (The time slots)</h2>
<ol>
<li>The first cell must be exactly "Schedule".</li>
<li>Every other cell must be a one character code for the weekday (M, T, W, R, F, S, U) followed by a space followed by a time in 24 hour format with a colon between the hour and the minute (e.g. "17:30").</li>
<li>Each time slot must be after the last time slot.</li>
<li>Each time slot extends until the next time slot.  This means that you MUST create at least one time slot at the end of each day which you set yourself as unavailable for (otherwise a 1 hour lessen may be scheduled in a 30 min slot).</li>
</ol>
<h2>The second row (Instructor preferences)</h2>
<ol>
<li>The first cell must be exactly "Available".</li>
<li>Every other cell must be empty or filled with exactly "1", "2", or "3".</li>
<li>Empty means that the instructor is not available at that time.</li>
<li>"1" means that the instructor would like to teach at that time.</li>
<li>"2" means that the instructor could teach at that time but would rather be watching monday night football or some other low priority but desirable thing that occurs AT THAT TIME (don't use this to ineffectually try to schedule a lunch or tell the system that you don't like coming in in the morning, there are better mechanisms available for specifying those preferences).</li>
<li>"3" is the same as "2" but much more so.</li>
</ol>
Lunch preferences L.
Complicated preferences A1,A1,A1,A2,A2,A2
Lets say that you have a deal with your spouse that on Tuesdays you EITHER bring the little rugrat to pre-school OR you cook lasagna in the evening.  Clearly, you can't schedule pupils both in the morning and in the evening.  However, which is better for your other scheduling needs?  You can let the program know about your marital constraints by making Tuesday morning and Tuesday evening mutually exclusive.  Pick a letter (for example "A") which will solve this particular constraint.  Pick a number (for example "1") to designate a set of slots which if they were all empty would solve your problem.  Meaning, mark all slots that you would need free in the morning in order to bring your child to school with "A1".  Pick another number (for example "2") and fill each slot which solves your problem in a different way with "A2".  Use as many numbers as necessary.  The slots marked with "A1" do not need to be at the same time or on the same day, so make sure that you don't reuse a letter.  If a single slot becomes part of multiple constraints you can specify them all by using a comma "," to separate the values (e.g. "A2,B1,C3,D2").
<h2>Specifying Preferences</h2>
<ol>
<li>Not all schedules are equally desirable.</li>
<li>Different instructors will have different preferences.</li>
<li>Each schedule has a penalty or bonus associated with it corresponding to how will it fits the instructors (and pupil's preferences).</li>
<li>If you would like to come in late, you can assign a bonus for every minute you start later in the day.</li>
<li>If you like to go home early, you can assign a bonus for every minute you leave earlier in the day.</li>
<li>If you don't like working long shifts, you can specify a penalty for every minute you work past 1 hour without a break.  You can also specify an additional penalty for every minute past 3 hours without a break.</li>
<li>You can assign how much of a penalty (per minute) scheduling a session on a slot you have marked with a "2" or a "3" is.</li>
<li>You can assign how much of a penalty (per minute) scheduling a session on a slot a pupil has marked with a "2" or a "3" is.</li>
<li>Each of these bonuses and penalties has a default value in one of 3 profiles ("I like sleeping in", "I like leaving early", "I like lots of breaks").  Feel free to use a profile or to set each value yourself.</li>
</ol>
Complicated constraints need to support specifying how many groups must be available.<br>
Bonus for missing an entire day.<br>
